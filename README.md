# Rest Api Demo - BlogPosts OpenAPI

<p> Demo app for testing RestApi Calls using MVI pattern. The app includes a login and register screen.
<p> The authentication is made through a token auto-generated by the server, when the user login or registers successfully.
<p> This token is then attached to the requests for making server calls and also used to check if the user is valid (logged) or invalid.
<p> Please note that less time was spent in the Design development. </p>

# Non-Goals
  <p>The main focus of this project was on HTTP requests and caching the data for offline use using the MVI pattern.</p>
  <p>The UI was't developed for making the design look better, only added the necessary components to show the results.</p>
  <br>
  
# App architecture
  <p>The app was developed taking in account the best practices and recommended architecture from Google for building apps.</p>
  <p>It uses the repository pattern and the single source of truth. Each component depends only on the component one level below it.
  For example, activities depend only on a view model. The repository is the only class that depends on multiple other classes.</p>
